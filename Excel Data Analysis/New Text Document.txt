                           *****DATA CLEANING*****

First we see any null or duplicate value by selecting whole column and add filter and see and null or duplicate value

we found like W and M so we select M with filter and press CTRL+F and replace all M with Men same process for W Women also

then we found in Qty where we changed One to 1 and Two to 2 with CRTL+F find and replace


                           *****DATA PROCESSING*****

We have a question about the relationship between gender and age for that we will process that 2 columns age and gender so i will create a new column "age group" and fill it with the logic if Ages 50 and above: "Senior"
Ages between 30 and 49: "Adult"
Ages below 30: "Teenager"

i will just paste this logic in chatgpt and copy the code BUT the code is littlebit wrong they gave column name of age is A i corrected it with E then the code will be like below
=IF(E2>=50, "Senior", IF(E2>=30, "Adult", "Teenager"))
to fill instantly all the rows of that column simply double click on right-downside corner of that cell

Now that values are showing by calculating the formula which can be resulted as slow the processing so what we do is i will first copy by selecting all the generated values with CTRL + C and right click Paste as value only NOT NECESSARY BUT RECOMMANDED
